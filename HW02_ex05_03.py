# Fermat's Last Theorem says that there are no positive integers a, b, and c 
# such that 
#        a^n + b^n = c^n 
# for any values of n greater than 2.

# (1) Write a function named check_fermat that takes four parameters-a, b, c and 
# n-and that checks to see if Fermat's theorem holds. If n is greater than 2 
# and it turns out to be true that
#        a^n + b^n = c^n 
# the program should print, "Holy smokes, Fermat was wrong!"" 
# Otherwise the program should print, "No, that doesn't work."

# (2) Write a function named check_fermat_ints that prompts the user to input 
# values for a, b, c and n, converts them to integers, and uses check_fermat
# to check whether they violate Fermat's theorem.
